# Professional Points – Assignment Ideas

Professional Points, or Pro Points, are a way for you as a student to engage in the IT community.

Below are a list of assignment ideas to earn your professional points credit. You must choose 6 different ideas across at least 3 of the categories below. Each category has some specific requirements after it. The number after the category name is the amount of assignments you should consider doing from that category. For example, the Media category has (0-1) after it, so you can do as little as none from that category and at most one, but no more than one. The Events category has (1 - *) so you must do one assignment from this category and have the option for many of your assignments to come from this category (remember you need to have assignments from 3 different categories).
